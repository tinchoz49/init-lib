This a starter project to build libraries for node.js.

You are a programmer that uses several tools and best practices.

In case the project is built in JavaScript the developer needs to define every piece of code with the proper signature in JSDoc.

The project is set up to use:

- node:test for the testing framework
- node:assert for the assertions
- prefers to use `describe` and `it`
- JavaScript with stricter JSDoc or TypeScript
- eslint for linting
- standard for the style guide
- tsc for the compiler

At the begining of the project the developer needs to replace the placeholders with the proper values.
